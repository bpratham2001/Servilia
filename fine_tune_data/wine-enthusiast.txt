Barolo or Brunello? - At their core, these wines showcase two of Italy’s most noble grape varieties, each with its own distinct personality and challenges. Both are known for high tannins, loads of acidity and, in monovarietal form, expressing their specific terroir with great detail and nuance. They are reserved varieties and begin to show themselves and what direction they want to go after a few days of fermentation.
Tuscan or Piedmontese wine? - Much of it comes down to Montalcino under the Tuscany sun versus Barolo under the Piedmontese fog. The soils are extremely different and Sangiovese has a better attitude to resist warmer climates than Nebbiolo. The approximately 600-square-meter Brunello appellation, which expands out from the hilltop city of Montalcino, is surrounded by rivers on three sides as well as an extinct volcano that helps to moderate the winds. This unique topography is what makes Brunello di Montalcino bottlings sing. in Barolo, wines are generally known for their wafting aromas that hint toward crushed raspberries or macerating cherries, laced with notes of dried rose, truffle and incense. Barolos are elegant and graceful with the power and agility of a ballet dancer. Though they do share common characteristics, Silvia Altare of Elio Altare in Barolo also emphasizes the importance of site-specificity in the region.
Where Are Late-Harvest Wines Produced? - In Germany, there are varying degrees of ripeness beyond late harvest: Auslese (selected harvest), Beerenauslese (berry selection) and Trockenberenausleese (dry berry selection). But late-harvest wines aren’t limited to Germany. In Bordeaux, the Sauternes region produces acclaimed wines using Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Northeastern Hungary is known for Tokaji Aszú, a prized dessert wine composed of Furmint, Hárslevelű and our other grape varieties. Eiswein (also known as Ice Wine) is often produced in Canada, Austria, Germany and the United States and is made with grapes that are left to freeze on the vine from December through late February, long after the traditional harvest period. These sweet wines are also made in lesser-known regions, too. There is a very special grape indigenous to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, that is often used in dessert wine called ‘Kalecik Karasi,’ as well as a grape called Bornova Misketi (100% Turkish Muscat) coming from Izmir, the city on the Aegean side of Turkey.
What Does a Late-Harvest Wine Taste Like? - Expect a late-harvest wine to have a deeper and more concentrated body. The fruit flavors of the wine will move from the realm of crunchy ‘fresh fruit’ and bright flavors to something riper and usually more oxidative. For example, ripe apples magically transform into candied apricots and peaches; with red wines, richer flavors and showcase some raisin or dehydrated flavors, while late-harvest white wines lend themselves to honeyed and candied fruit flavors. Elevated sugar content acts as a natural preservative, which is a core reason that late-harvest wines are able to age terrifically. If the wine in question is made from a high acid grape, such as Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc, that can buy it an even longer lifespan.
What’s the Difference Between Late Harvest and Noble Rot? - While many of the most famous late-harvest wines (like Sauternes and Tokaji Aszu) are also impacted by noble rot, the two processes are unrelated in the vineyard. Noble rot refers to Botrytis cinerea, a beneficial fungus that can grow on grapes and dry them out while concentrating sugars; late harvest, on the other hand, refers to the time that the grapes are harvested. Botrytis very famously presents with saffron and honey aromas, which, when balanced, add terrific complexity and depth to the finished wines. While late-harvest wines will generally give the honeyed, intense fruit presentation, the spice and complexity added by noble rot is truly the distinguishing factor.
Where is Sonoma County? - Sonoma County, just an hour north of San Francisco, might not have the international reputation that the neighboring Napa Valley does, but it still has plenty for wine lovers to be excited about. This historic region was first planted in the early 1800s and has grown wine grapes ever since. It boasts a dizzying array of climates and soil types, making it an ideal home for a wide range of varietals and wine styles. From crisp, refreshing whites to full-bodied and age-worthy reds, there’s something for every palate.
How is the Chardonnay from Sonoma County? - Chardonnay is the single most popular grape in the county—red or white. And why not? Winemakers love working with Burgundian varietal, as it can be made in a wide range of styles, from heavily oaked and decadent, to mineral-driven and acid-forward. This versatility gives wine lovers loads of options, but the classic examples from the Russian River Valley really deliver the best of both worlds. It’s no wonder these wines have exploded in popularity since the AVA was founded in the early eighties—and have helped cement California’s reputation as a global wine powerhouse. Foggy mornings and a long growing season provide brilliant acidity, while warm days provide optimal ripeness and opulent texture. The ability to have the best of both worlds has made Chardonnay from this region popular all over the world.
How is the Pinot Noir from Sonoma County? - Ask wine lovers what the most complex grape is and often, you’ll hear about Pinot Noir. Ask growers which variety is the toughest to farm and you’re very likely to get the same answer. Pinot’s thin skin and relatively high acid make for nuanced and aromatically compelling wines, and the grape thrives in cooler growing zones. The AVAs located along Sonoma County’s coastline, such as Fort Ross-Seaview and West Sonoma Coast, share a proximity to the Pacific Ocean and foggy mornings that provide the perfect climate for gradual ripening and complex flavor profiles, like forest floor, nori and shiitake, making them ideal for this tricky but magical grape.
What is the Cabernet Sauvignon from Sonoma County like? - Just over the Mayacamas Mountains, in Napa Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon is king. The wines from the western side of this range in the Moon Mountain and Sonoma Valley AVAs can be just as age worthy and satisfying and are generally more affordable. Here, Cabernet is supple and nuanced, with lower alcohol and less overt oak treatment. Collectors have long known to find value here, but nowadays, top estates in Sonoma are producing truly world class examples of Cabernet with flavors of plum, cassis and volcanic character that belong in every serious cellar.
What is the Zinfandel from Sonoma County like? - Among the earliest plantings in Sonoma County, Zinfandel was prized by early settlers from Hungary and Italy. These robust reds (frequently planted alongside Petite Sirah, Alicante Bouschet, Carignane and other Rhône varieties) have stood the test of time, with many of California’s oldest plantings of “old-vine Zin” dating back well over a century. Lytton Springs, Pagani Ranch, Mancini Ranch, Jackass Hill and Monte Rosso are some of the most sought-after parcels, with winemakers and collectors alike seeking out sources for these uniquely American wines. While it’s tricky to generalize the flavors in these types of wines, as the mix of other varieties can really change the profile, it’s safe to say that they all carry some intense berry character and spice notes. The Russian River Valley and Dry Creek Valley both have a number of these historic sites, as do Sonoma Valley and Moon Mountain.
What's the Syrah like in Sonoma County? - A frequent addition to the vine rows that make up many of those old vine field blends, Syrah has come into its own in Sonoma’s coastal regions. The cool nights, foggy mornings and steep hillsides in west Sonoma Coast and Fort Ross-Seaview are the perfect climate for an aromatically enchanting and lower alcohol style of Syrah than those generally grown in Napa Valley or the Central Coast. These wines tend to possess more than a little bit of the classic Northern Rhône Valley Syrah character, displaying black olive and bacon flavors, but retain a distinct California depth and richness.
What's the Grenache like in Sonoma County? - The Rhône Valley’s other noble variety, Grenache, also carved out a niche for itself as a member of those “mixed black” varieties planted around the county so long ago. Grenache has long been popular with growers, as it thrives in bright, sunny locations and provides a hefty crop more often than not. In Sonoma, it can be soft and fruit driven or hearty and potent, depending on the location. But it thrives in areas with volcanic soils, like the rocky slopes of Moon Mountain, where it sings with added complexity and beguiling notes like kirsch, purple flowers and savory spices.
Your thoughts on the Sangiovese from Sonoma County? - The noble grape of Tuscany came to California with Italian immigrants early on and gained steam after the turn of the century, when Edoardo Seghesio purchased ten acres of land in Sonoma. Those Sangiovese vineyards gave birth to a uniquely American clone of the classic Chianti varietal, featuring robust cherry and raspberry flavors with layers of spice and minerality. The booming rise of Zinfandel in the eighties and nineties brought more attention to the Italian-American growers, and eventually the so-called Cal-Ital wines blossomed in popularity. While Sangiovese still makes up a small fraction of Sonoma County’s acreage, its historic significance shouldn’t be overlooked.
What do you think of the Sauvignon Blanc in Sonoma County? - Sauvignon Blanc is among the world’s most popular white wines; it’s grown all over, in a wide range of different styles. Examples from New Zealand are racy and intense, while the classic versions from Bordeaux are deep and nuanced. The best versions from Sonoma County tend to come from hilly growing zones like Bennett Valley and Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak, where the wines are made with the richer Bordeaux style in mind. Layered and textural, with brilliant acidity and classic California fruit, like Meyer lemon, pomelo and melon, Sonoma’s best Sauvignon Blancs compete with the world’s greatest.
Best overall wine to pair with steak? - It’s hard to argue against a well-made Napa Cab as the ideal partner for all types of steak. There’s a reason most steakhouses have Bible-sized wine lists disproportionately filled with Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. Few wines deliver the kind of high-alcohol and tannic body blow required to tangle with such a full-flavored protein. A glass of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon can help the flavors linger for longer. The buttery-black sear on a good steak also mirrors the toast of the oak barrels Napa Cabs are aged in, allowing the char and the tannin to merge while the wine’s considerable fruits dart through.
What should I pair with a New York strip steak? - Sometimes known as sirloin, top loin, Delmonico steak or Kansas City strip, it’s an incredibly versatile cut that can take the flavors of a unique style of Napa Cab. Most will recognize the New York strip as the Broadway-sized intersection of texture, flavor and fat that made it so famous. One sub-AVA announces itself as the strip’s most natural counterpart: St. Helena AVA from The Valley floor. It’s a powerful expression of Jolly Rancher fruits, like cranberry and raspberry, with a savory jamminess and violet-laced cedar core that drops a big, red Times Square ball of flavor on any New York strip.
How should I pair a nice Ribeye Steak? - Ribeye is the richest cut of steak, lusciously marbled with fat throughout. This is where you can really play with the interaction between tannins and beef fat. I recommend Napa's hillside AVAs, like Diamond Mountain. These wines are so rugged and burly, they almost seem chewy, with a wet-dark earthiness. If you aren’t careful, they might be just brawny enough to make you grab that meat by the bone. It can be even more fun to experiment with some lesser-known high-tannin wines, like Tannat, Petit Verdot, Mourvedre, Sagrantino or Touriga Nacional. These rarely have as worthy a culinary opponent as a ribeye steak. Uruguay consumes the second most beef per capita of any country in the world, so wine from a steak-loving, wine-growing area feels natural. After all, there are few Uruguayan asados without bottles of Tannat on the table.
Best Italian for steak? - While classic Italian reds like Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello and Amarone can pair beautifully with a juicy cut of meat, I suggest heading to Tuscany for a superior choice. I encourage pouring a Super Tuscan, the colloquial name for wines that operate outside the rules of such Tuscany DOCGs as Chianti and Brunello. These wines most often blend Sangiovese with Bordeaux varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Super Tuscan styles can vary, but what they all share is a unique broadside of freshness and power, and a juiciness that snaps to attention with a powerful piece of protein. The wine’s guaranteed acidic streak and beefy tannins from all the thick-skinned grapes work overtime to provide an Old World pairing akin to its New World brethren, with interestingly nuanced differences.
What's a good French wine for steak? - While it may make sense to pour a Cabernet Sauvignon when going French, I suggest another Bordeaux favorite. Consider a Merlot, particularly one from Pomerol, the right bank Bordeaux appellation where Merlot shows its well-known plushness and considerable tannic structure. Pomerol produces Merlot that smells like so many things at once it can leave you guessing for days. Think black plum, black cherry and boysenberry with notes of violet, tobacco leaf and mint. Depending on the producer, Pomerol ranges from medium-bodied and supple, to big-bodied and bold. But every last one of its iterations is a cuddle puddle of lust for steak au poivre.
Wine pairing for steak & lobster? - Though pairing red wine with seafood isn’t off the table, there are white wine varieties bold enough to stand up to this classic surf and turf. Warm-climate Chardonnay that's been barrel-aged or barrel-fermented is intense enough to match flavorful red meat as well as the naturally sweet lobster. Also, Pinot Noir has minimal tannins compared to heavier reds, but it's still enough to work with red meat without overpowering the lobster. When ordering surf and turf, go for a leaner steak, like filet mignon. Leaner cuts such as filet mignon are great pairings for these 'crossover' wines that pair well with both meat and seafood.
Recommend me a good Rosé to go with steak. - When it comes to pouring a pink-hued wine with a fatty steak, I suggest opting for Champagne. The effervescence cuts the fat and also refreshes the palate, while the red and citrus fruit match the intensity of the beef flavors. The yeasty bread component gives complexity and complementary flavors. The florals round out the experience and can match all cuts of steak because of the diverse flavors and complex structure of the wine.
Best wine for steak tartare? - Raw steak is naturally lighter in intensity and many tartare recipes include tart, contrasting flavors and deeply savory herbs. Rosé is the best of both white and red worlds. It has red and citrus fruit profiles, lifted with florals and often a mineral or stony baseline of flavor. They are also moderate in body to match the body of the tartare, and have enough acidity to complement the interesting flavors.
Advise me on Pinot Noir for steak. - If you enjoy a lighter red, Pinot Noir can be a great option to complement a steak, while sticking to your personal preferences. I would probably head to Patagonia, which is the southernmost wine-producing region in the Americas, and its arid valleys make some of the best Pinot Noir in the world. Its extreme winters and cool summer nights make for a prolonged growing season that’s particularly well suited for Pinot. Bright and high toned enough for dense protein, it’s also notable for its earthy undercurrents, which a nice mushroom accompaniment would lap right up.
Give me some advice on white wine for steak. - I recognize that the concept of white wine and beef may seem suspect to some, but experiencing the smoky, buttery, indulgently rich flavors of a Meursault with a filet mignon or Porterhouse will quickly dispel any notions of incompatibility. And what makes this pairing race full throttle is the teeming acidity that has a similar effect on the fat in steak as the tannins in red wine. It turns the volume up in your palate and then washes you clean for the next bite.
What do you think of sweet wines to pair with a steak? - Sweet wines have a surprising amount of body that can give an unexpected harmony with steak. An Auslese Riesling from Germany offers decadent stone fruit character and enhanced silky texture from residual sugar, but it's all in balance. It's especially good when the steak comes with tart or spicy accompaniments. Alternatively, I recommend a demi-sec Champagne. Their bright acidity brings balance and lift, making the style surprisingly versatile. And due to the autolytic character—think toasty, yeasty and brioche notes—and sea-salt minerality, I'd baste my favorite cut with butter to tie all the sweet and savory goodness together.
white or red with pork? - When it comes to the color of wine, pork can pair just as well with various styles of white wine, rosé and sparkling as well as light- or full-bodied reds. The salty nature makes it great for bubbles. It’s good with oaky whites, especially if it’s smoked pork. So, something like a white Burgundy—like a Mersault with age to it—that has developed richness and smoky hazelnut flavors would be really good with smoked pork. Off-dry whites, too. Riesling with a kiss of residual sugar, like a Kabinett or Spätlese from the Mosel, would be good with pork dishes too. And don’t forget the lean and crisp, slightly herbaceous whites. Those wines can go really well because the acid can be great for cutting through the fatness and the richness of some pork dishes.
What should I not pair with pork? - Although there are no specific rules for matching pork with wine, there are a few points worth keeping in mind to create the optimal wine and pork pairing. Among them, steering clear of highly acidic wines if the pork dish is spicy. It’ll be too much for your mouth. The acid will just cut through everything, and you won’t feel anything other than bitterness. I would caution against high alcohol and heavily oaked wines for spicy pork dishes as well. That will only heighten the sensation of spice, which can make that feeling more uncomfortable. The burn of the alcohol combined with the burn of spice, especially if you’re sensitive, can be really off-putting. However, a spicy pork dish and a sweeter wine pairing can go a long way because the sweetness and the fruitiness of some wines will help calm down all that heat in your mouth. Fat and acid go together great because acid cuts through the fat the same way that wines tend to be very rich and bold and have a creaminess to them.
What is palate blowout? - The idea of hopping from vineyard to vineyard to sip wines may sound appealing for the average consumer in search of the perfect bottle (and, frankly, buzz), but even for sommeliers, winemakers and industry professionals, there is such a thing as too much vino. Palate blowout, the phenomenon of losing your sense of taste after overconsumption, can cause the mouth to not only tire, but also render ineffective. After all, a numb tongue is a tongue that can’t pick up on the flavor nuances of different vintages and varietals, at which point you’re better off downing shots of cheap vodka.
How can I avoid palate blowout? - 1. Hydration, Hydration, Hydration. 2. Avoid Outside Scents. 3. Go from Light to Heavy. 4. Rely on Bubbles. 5. Consume Neutral Foods. 6. Swig and Spit. 7. Don’t Overdo it.
